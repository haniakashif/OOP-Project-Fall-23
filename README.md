# Heist at the Royal Castle üè∞

Welcome to the OOP Project repository for the Fall semester of 2023! Our project proposal introduces Heist at the Royal Castle, a simple 2D top-down game crafted using C++ and the SDL library, employing object-oriented programming for its development. In this game, the player assumes the role of a thief on a daring mission. The primary goal is to infiltrate a castle, find the three keys to unlock the treasure, and win the game with at least one life of 3 initial lives. The player also encounters enemies and has to overcome obstacles during the heist.

## How to Compile

To compile the game, run the following command on your terminal:

```bash
g++ *.cpp -IC:\mingw_dev_lib\include\SDL2 -LC:\mingw_dev_lib\lib -w -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_mixer
